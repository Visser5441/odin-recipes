    <h2>Tell Me About The Burger </h2>
    <P> </P>
    <P>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!</P>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>4 Hamburger Buns</li>
       <li>2 Tablespoons butter</li> 
       <li>1 Pound Ground Beef</li>
       <li>Pinch of salt </li>
       <li>4 Slices American Chesse</li>
       <li>Burgers Tpooings of Choice</li>
    </ul>

       <h3>Steps</h3>

       <ol>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4></li>
        <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</p>
        <li><h4>Step 2</h4></li>
        <p>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</p>
        <li><h4>Step 3</h4></li>
        <p>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</p>
        <li><h4>Step 4</h4></li>
        <p>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>Top Tips</h3>

        <p>If you only have one spatula, wrap your other hand in an old dish towel for protection, and use it to press down on the spatula with both hands.</p>
        <p>You can make 4 (4 ounce) patties instead of 8 (2 ounce patties), but I prefer the thinner patties that have more crispy surface area.</p>
